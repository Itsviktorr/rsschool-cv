## About Me

I hold a higher education degree in Law, and I am currently making a career transition into the field of Information Technology. Although my background is not technical, I am highly motivated and eager to learn. I have always been passionate about technology and design, and that’s what led me to explore programming as a new professional path. I find the process of creating digital interfaces fascinating — especially how code can shape user experience and visual presentation. I’m currently starting from scratch and focusing on learning JavaScript as my first programming language. I chose JavaScript because it combines logic with creativity, allowing me to understand the fundamentals of web development while also getting closer to UI/UX design. In addition to JavaScript, I am gradually learning HTML and CSS, building small projects, and experimenting with web page layouts and interactive elements. My goal is to eventually become a front-end developer who can contribute not only with code but with an understanding of design thinking and user-centric development. I'm also starting to explore tools like Git,GitHub, and working with Markdown, which helps me document my progress and structure my learning journey. I may be a beginner in programming, but I bring with me strong analytical thinking, responsibility, and a desire to constantly improve — skills that served me well in the legal profession and that I now apply to my studies in IT. I believe that with persistence, curiosity, and structured learning, I can grow into a confident and creative developer.

let firstHalfSum = 0;
let secondHalfSum = 0;

let half = 
Math.floor(arr.length / 2);

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i < half) {
        firstHalfSum += arr[i];
    } else {
        secondHalfSum += arr[i];
    }
}

let result = firstHalfSum / secondHalfSum;
